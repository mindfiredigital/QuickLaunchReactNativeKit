# Theme

Theming is about crafting a cohesive visual identity for your application, ensuring a seamless experience for users. It encompasses a harmonious blend of style attributes and reusable components that define the app's aesthetic.

Theming involves several key elements: colors, font sizes, typography, and spacing. All these elements are consolidated within the `src/theme` folder. When starting a new project, exploring this directory is crucial, aligning the values with the intended design.

By leveraging these modules, developers can maintain a consistent typography system across the application while easily managing font assets and styles.

## Colors

In our application, colors are managed through the `src/theme/colors.ts` file. We follow a palette-based methodology to organize our colors effectively. This approach involves defining a cohesive set of colors to be utilized throughout the application. By assigning semantic names to these colors, we ensure consistency and facilitate easy palette adjustments.

This structured approach not only promotes uniformity in our color scheme but also enables seamless modifications to the palette when necessary.
